# Gastric_xQTL Project

## Overview
This repository contains the codebase used in the study  
**"Transcriptome-wide association studies identify new gastric cancer susceptibility genes through genetic regulation of expression, alternative splicing and polyadenylation"**,  
covering both main analyses and figures generation scripts.

The project aims to identify genetic variants contributing to gastric cancer risk by analyzing gastric-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), splicing QTLs (sQTLs), and alternative polyadenylation QTLs (apaQTLs). The code is divided into two main sections:

1. **Codes for Main Analyses**: Scripts for quatifying events, mapping QTLs, and performing transcriptome-wide and regulome-wide association study (TWAS).  
2. **Codes for Figures**: Scripts used to produce the main figures presented in the study.

## **Usage Instructions**

### **Main Analyses**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required environments (e.g., LeafCutter, DaPars2, FUSION).
3. Execute scripts under the "Codes for Main Analyses" section.

### **Figures Generation**
1. Install R and required R packages.
2. Run the relevant R scripts to generate each figure.
